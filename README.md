# Gajima üîÑ üçõ - Another Loading and Processing Bar in Python Again

## Are there any other Squidwards(X) python progressbar(O) ?

- *A side product of Qurry üçõ - The Measuring Tool for Renyi Entropy, Loschmidt Echo, and Magnetization Squared, The Library of Some Common Cases*

This is a progressbar which dedicated for Qurry üçõ, due to other progress bar modules make some printing issue when prints only text on jupyter notebook, bringing a not good experince, specific for VS Code Jupyter Notebook.

**This module is far from finish and will update frenquently with the development of Qurry üçõ .**

## Why this name ?

It's meaning "Don't leave" in Korean.
Select this name because when I tested its main function,
I was listening **TVXQ - Catch Me (Korean ver.)**, and "Gajima" is its lyrics.
So there is it.
